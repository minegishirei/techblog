## Docker EnginのAPI

Docker EnginにはAPIが存在します。
必ずしもdockerコマンドから実行する必要はなく、 **HTTPプロトコルでAPIに欲しいイメージ、コンテナを伝えることができればいいです。**

今回はそんなDocker EnginのAPIを翻訳していきます。

Docker EnginのAPIはSwagger形式で書かれているので、それをMarkdownとして起こしました。

以下参考のurlです。

# Docker Engine API

Engine APIは、Docker Engine によって提供される HTTP APIです。
Dockerクライアントはエンジンとの連携のためにAPIを使用するため、 **Dockerクライアントができることは、すべてAPI を使用して行うことができます。**

ほとんどのDockerのクライアントコマンドはAPIのエンドポイントと一対一対応してます。
例えば、 `docker ps`コマンドで得られるDockerのプロセス情報は、`GET /containers/json`で同じ情報を得られます。

ですが当然その例外も存在し、例えばコンテナを実行する際には複数のAPIを呼び出す必要があります。


# Errors

APIのエラーメッセージは通常のHTTPステータスコードで表されます。

JSONのフォーマットは以下の通りです。

```
{
  "message": "page not found"
}
```

# Versioning

The API is usually changed in each release, so API calls are versioned to
ensure that clients don't break. To lock to a specific version of the API,
you prefix the URL with its version, for example, call `/v1.30/info` to use
the v1.30 version of the `/info` endpoint. If the API version specified in
the URL is not supported by the daemon, a HTTP `400 Bad Request` error message
is returned.

If you omit the version-prefix, the current version of the API (v1.42) is used.
For example, calling `/info` is the same as calling `/v1.42/info`. Using the
API without a version-prefix is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

Engine releases in the near future should support this version of the API,
so your client will continue to work even if it is talking to a newer Engine.

The API uses an open schema model, which means server may add extra properties
to responses. Likewise, the server will ignore any extra query parameters and
request body properties. When you write clients, you need to ignore additional
properties in responses to ensure they do not break when talking to newer
daemons.


# Authentication

Authentication for registries is handled client side. The client has to send
authentication details to various endpoints that need to communicate with
registries, such as `POST /images/(name)/push`. These are sent as
`X-Registry-Auth` header as a [base64url encoded](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-5)
(JSON) string with the following structure:

```
{
  "username": "string",
  "password": "string",
  "email": "string",
  "serveraddress": "string"
}
```

The `serveraddress` is a domain/IP without a protocol. Throughout this
structure, double quotes are required.

If you have already got an identity token from the [`/auth` endpoint](#operation/SystemAuth),
you can just pass this instead of credentials:

```
{
  "identitytoken": "9cbaf023786cd7..."
}
```


## Version: 1.42

### /containers/json

#### GET
##### Summary:

List containers

##### Description:

Returns a list of containers. For details on the format, see the
[inspect endpoint](#operation/ContainerInspect).

Note that it uses a different, smaller representation of a container
than inspecting a single container. For example, the list of linked
containers is not propagated .

| ---- | ---------- | ----------- | -------- | ---- |
| all | query | Return all containers. By default, only running containers are shown.  | No | boolean |
| limit | query | Return this number of most recently created containers, including non-running ones.  | No | integer |
| size | query | Return the size of container as fields `SizeRw` and `SizeRootFs`.  | No | boolean |
| filters | query | Filters to process on the container list, encoded as JSON (a `map[string][]string`). For example, `{"status": ["paused"]}` will only return paused containers.  Available filters:  - `ancestor`=(`<image-name>[:<tag>]`, `<image id>`, or `<image@digest>`) - `before`=(`<container id>` or `<container name>`) - `expose`=(`<port>[/<proto>]`|`<startport-endport>/[<proto>]`) - `exited=<int>` containers with exit code of `<int>` - `health`=(`starting`|`healthy`|`unhealthy`|`none`) - `id=<ID>` a container's ID - `isolation=`(`default`|`process`|`hyperv`) (Windows daemon only) - `is-task=`(`true`|`false`) - `label=key` or `label="key=value"` of a container label - `name=<name>` a container's name - `network`=(`<network id>` or `<network name>`) - `publish`=(`<port>[/<proto>]`|`<startport-endport>/[<proto>]`) - `since`=(`<container id>` or `<container name>`) - `status=`(`created`|`restarting`|`running`|`removing`|`paused`|`exited`|`dead`) - `volume`=(`<volume name>` or `<mount point destination>`)  | No | string |

### /containers/{id}/stats

#### GET
##### Summary:

Get container stats based on resource usage

##### Description:

This endpoint returns a live stream of a container’s resource usage
statistics.

The `precpu_stats` is the CPU statistic of the *previous* read, and is
used to calculate the CPU usage percentage. It is not an exact copy
of the `cpu_stats` field.

If either `precpu_stats.online_cpus` or `cpu_stats.online_cpus` is
nil then for compatibility with older daemons the length of the
corresponding `cpu_usage.percpu_usage` array should be used.

On a cgroup v2 host, the following fields are not set
* `blkio_stats`: all fields other than `io_service_bytes_recursive`
* `cpu_stats`: `cpu_usage.percpu_usage`
* `memory_stats`: `max_usage` and `failcnt`
Also, `memory_stats.stats` fields are incompatible with cgroup v1.

To calculate the values shown by the `stats` command of the docker cli tool
the following formulas can be used:
* used_memory = `memory_stats.usage - memory_stats.stats.cache`
* available_memory = `memory_stats.limit`
* Memory usage % = `(used_memory / available_memory) * 100.0`
* cpu_delta = `cpu_stats.cpu_usage.total_usage - precpu_stats.cpu_usage.total_usage`
* system_cpu_delta = `cpu_stats.system_cpu_usage - precpu_stats.system_cpu_usage`
* number_cpus = `lenght(cpu_stats.cpu_usage.percpu_usage)` or `cpu_stats.online_cpus`
* CPU usage % = `(cpu_delta / system_cpu_delta) * number_cpus * 100.0`


##### Parameters

| Name | Located in | Description | Required | Schema |
| ---- | ---------- | ----------- | -------- | ---- |
| id | path | ID or name of the container | Yes | string |
| stream | query | Stream the output. If false, the stats will be output once and then it will disconnect.  | No | boolean |
| one-shot | query | Only get a single stat instead of waiting for 2 cycles. Must be used with `stream=false`.  | No | boolean |

##### Responses

| Code | Description | Schema |

### /containers/{id}/attach

#### POST
##### Summary:

Attach to a container

##### Description:

Attach to a container to read its output or send it input. You can attach
to the same container multiple times and you can reattach to containers
that have been detached.

Either the `stream` or `logs` parameter must be `true` for this endpoint
to do anything.

See the [documentation for the `docker attach` command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/attach/)
for more details.

### Hijacking

This endpoint hijacks the HTTP connection to transport `stdin`, `stdout`,
and `stderr` on the same socket.

This is the response from the daemon for an attach request:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/vnd.docker.raw-stream

[STREAM]
```

After the headers and two new lines, the TCP connection can now be used
for raw, bidirectional communication between the client and server.

To hint potential proxies about connection hijacking, the Docker client
can also optionally send connection upgrade headers.

For example, the client sends this request to upgrade the connection:

```
POST /containers/16253994b7c4/attach?stream=1&stdout=1 HTTP/1.1
Upgrade: tcp
Connection: Upgrade
```

The Docker daemon will respond with a `101 UPGRADED` response, and will
similarly follow with the raw stream:

```
HTTP/1.1 101 UPGRADED
Content-Type: application/vnd.docker.raw-stream
Connection: Upgrade
Upgrade: tcp

[STREAM]
```

### Stream format

When the TTY setting is disabled in [`POST /containers/create`](#operation/ContainerCreate),
the HTTP Content-Type header is set to application/vnd.docker.multiplexed-stream
and the stream over the hijacked connected is multiplexed to separate out
`stdout` and `stderr`. The stream consists of a series of frames, each
containing a header and a payload.

The header contains the information which the stream writes (`stdout` or
`stderr`). It also contains the size of the associated frame encoded in
the last four bytes (`uint32`).

It is encoded on the first eight bytes like this:

```go
header := [8]byte{STREAM_TYPE, 0, 0, 0, SIZE1, SIZE2, SIZE3, SIZE4}
```

`STREAM_TYPE` can be:

- 0: `stdin` (is written on `stdout`)
- 1: `stdout`
- 2: `stderr`

`SIZE1, SIZE2, SIZE3, SIZE4` are the four bytes of the `uint32` size
encoded as big endian.

Following the header is the payload, which is the specified number of
bytes of `STREAM_TYPE`.

The simplest way to implement this protocol is the following:

1. Read 8 bytes.
2. Choose `stdout` or `stderr` depending on the first byte.
3. Extract the frame size from the last four bytes.
4. Read the extracted size and output it on the correct output.
5. Goto 1.

### Stream format when using a TTY

When the TTY setting is enabled in [`POST /containers/create`](#operation/ContainerCreate),
the stream is not multiplexed. The data exchanged over the hijacked
connection is simply the raw data from the process PTY and client's
`stdin`.

| logs | query | Replay previous logs from the container.  This is useful for attaching to a container that has started and you want to output everything since the container started.  If `stream` is also enabled, once all the previous output has been returned, it will seamlessly transition into streaming current output.  | No | boolean |
| stream | query | Stream attached streams from the time the request was made onwards.  | No | boolean |

### /build

#### POST
##### Summary:

イメージファイルをビルドします。

ビルドの際には`Dockerfile`を含むtar圧縮ファイルを送信する必要があります。

##### Description:

`Dockerfile`を含むtar圧縮ファイルからDockerイメージを作ります。

ビルドの際には、`Dockerfile`は通常はアーカイブのルートにある想定で動作しますが、`dockerfile` パラメータを指定することで、別のパスに配置したり、別の名前を付けたりすることができます。

[`Dockerfile`についての詳しい動作はこちらをご確認ください。](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).

`Docker`デーモンは、ビルドを開始する前に「`Dockerfile`」の事前検証を実行し、構文が正しくない場合はエラーを返します。
その後、新しいイメージの ID が出力されるまで、`Dockerfile`に記述された各命令が1行ずつ実行されます。

HTTPコネクションが途切れた場合、buildは中断されます。



##### Parameters

| Name | Located in | Description | Required | Schema |
| ---- | ---------- | ----------- | -------- | ---- |
| inputStream | body | `Dockerfile`を含む圧縮されたファイル。圧縮形式は次のいずれかの通り。gzip, bzip2, xz. | No | binary |
| dockerfile | query | 圧縮されたフォルダー内での`Dockerfile`のファイルパス. このオプションは`remote`と外部の`Dockerfile`の場所が指定されば場合には無視されます。 | No | string |
| t | query | A name and optional tag to apply to the image in the `name:tag` format. If you omit the tag the default `latest` value is assumed. You can provide several `t` parameters. | No | string |
| extrahosts | query | Extra hosts to add to /etc/hosts | No | string |
| remote | query | A Git repository URI or HTTP/HTTPS context URI. If the URI points to a single text file, the file’s contents are placed into a file called `Dockerfile` and the image is built from that file. If the URI points to a tarball, the file is downloaded by the daemon and the contents therein used as the context for the build. If the URI points to a tarball and the `dockerfile` parameter is also specified, there must be a file with the corresponding path inside the tarball. | No | string |
| q | query | Suppress verbose build output. | No | boolean |
| nocache | query | Do not use the cache when building the image. | No | boolean |
| cachefrom | query | JSON array of images used for build cache resolution. | No | string |
| pull | query | Attempt to pull the image even if an older image exists locally. | No | string |
| rm | query | Remove intermediate containers after a successful build. | No | boolean |
| forcerm | query | Always remove intermediate containers, even upon failure. | No | boolean |
| memory | query | Set memory limit for build. | No | integer |
| memswap | query | Total memory (memory + swap). Set as `-1` to disable swap. | No | integer |
| cpushares | query | CPU shares (relative weight). | No | integer |
| cpusetcpus | query | CPUs in which to allow execution (e.g., `0-3`, `0,1`). | No | string |
| cpuperiod | query | The length of a CPU period in microseconds. | No | integer |
| cpuquota | query | Microseconds of CPU time that the container can get in a CPU period. | No | integer |
| buildargs | query | JSON map of string pairs for build-time variables. Users pass these values at build-time. Docker uses the buildargs as the environment context for commands run via the `Dockerfile` RUN instruction, or for variable expansion in other `Dockerfile` instructions. This is not meant for passing secret values.  For example, the build arg `FOO=bar` would become `{"FOO":"bar"}` in JSON. This would result in the query parameter `buildargs={"FOO":"bar"}`. Note that `{"FOO":"bar"}` should be URI component encoded.  [Read more about the buildargs instruction.](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#arg)  | No | string |
| shmsize | query | Size of `/dev/shm` in bytes. The size must be greater than 0. If omitted the system uses 64MB. | No | integer |
| squash | query | Squash the resulting images layers into a single layer. *(Experimental release only.)* | No | boolean |
| labels | query | Arbitrary key/value labels to set on the image, as a JSON map of string pairs. | No | string |
| networkmode | query | Sets the networking mode for the run commands during build. Supported standard values are: `bridge`, `host`, `none`, and `container:<name|id>`. Any other value is taken as a custom network's name or ID to which this container should connect to.  | No | string |
| Content-type | header |  | No | string |
| X-Registry-Config | header | This is a base64-encoded JSON object with auth configurations for multiple registries that a build may refer to.  The key is a registry URL, and the value is an auth configuration object, [as described in the authentication section](#section/Authentication). For example:  ``` {   "docker.example.com": {     "username": "janedoe",     "password": "hunter2"   },   "https://index.docker.io/v1/": {     "username": "mobydock",     "password": "conta1n3rize14"   } } ```  Only the registry domain name (and port if not the default 443) are required. However, for legacy reasons, the Docker Hub registry must be specified with both a `https://` prefix and a `/v1/` suffix even though Docker will prefer to use the v2 registry API.  | No | string |
| platform | query | Platform in the format os[/arch[/variant]] | No | string |
| target | query | Target build stage | No | string |
| outputs | query | BuildKit output configuration | No | string |

| platform | query | Platform in the format os[/arch[/variant]].  When used in combination with the `fromImage` option, the daemon checks if the given image is present in the local image cache with the given OS and Architecture, and otherwise attempts to pull the image. If the option is not set, the host's native OS and Architecture are used. If the given image does not exist in the local image cache, the daemon attempts to pull the image with the host's native OS and Architecture. If the given image does exists in the local image cache, but its OS or architecture does not match, a warning is produced.  When used with the `fromSrc` option to import an image from an archive, this option sets the platform information for the imported image. If the option is not set, the host's native OS and Architecture are used for the imported image.  | No | string |

### /images/{name}/get

#### GET
##### Summary:

Export an image

##### Description:

Get a tarball containing all images and metadata for a repository.

If `name` is a specific name and tag (e.g. `ubuntu:latest`), then only that image (and its parents) are returned. If `name` is an image ID, similarly only that image (and its parents) are returned, but with the exclusion of the `repositories` file in the tarball, as there were no image names referenced.

### Image tarball format

An image tarball contains one directory per image layer (named using its long ID), each containing these files:

- `VERSION`: currently `1.0` - the file format version
- `json`: detailed layer information, similar to `docker inspect layer_id`
- `layer.tar`: A tarfile containing the filesystem changes in this layer

The `layer.tar` file contains `aufs` style `.wh..wh.aufs` files and directories for storing attribute changes and deletions.

If the tarball defines a repository, the tarball should also include a `repositories` file at the root that contains a list of repository and tag names mapped to layer IDs.

```json
{
  "hello-world": {
    "latest": "565a9d68a73f6706862bfe8409a7f659776d4d60a8d096eb4a3cbce6999cc2a1"

repositories.

For each value of the `names` parameter: if it is a specific name and
tag (e.g. `ubuntu:latest`), then only that image (and its parents) are
returned; if it is an image ID, similarly only that image (and its parents)
are returned and there would be no names referenced in the 'repositories'

#### ObjectVersion

The version number of the object such as node, service, etc. This is needed

on the object may not be applied if the version number has changed from the
last read. In other words, if two update requests specify the same base
version, only one of the requests can succeed. As a result, two separate
update requests that happen at the same time will not unintentionally
overwrite each other.

| AllowNondistributableArtifactsCIDRs | [ string ] | List of IP ranges to which nondistributable artifacts can be pushed, using the CIDR syntax [RFC 4632](https://tools.ietf.org/html/4632).  Some images (for example, Windows base images) contain artifacts whose distribution is restricted by license. When these images are pushed to a registry, restricted artifacts are not included.  This configuration override this behavior, and enables the daemon to push nondistributable artifacts to all registries whose resolved IP address is within the subnet described by the CIDR syntax.  This option is useful when pushing images containing nondistributable artifacts to a registry on an air-gapped network so hosts on that network can pull the images without connecting to another server.  > **Warning**: Nondistributable artifacts typically have restrictions > on how and where they can be distributed and shared. Only use this > feature to push artifacts to private registries and ensure that you > are in compliance with any terms that cover redistributing > nondistributable artifacts.  | No |
| AllowNondistributableArtifactsHostnames | [ string ] | List of registry hostnames to which nondistributable artifacts can be pushed, using the format `<hostname>[:<port>]` or `<IP address>[:<port>]`.  Some images (for example, Windows base images) contain artifacts whose distribution is restricted by license. When these images are pushed to a registry, restricted artifacts are not included.  This configuration override this behavior for the specified registries.  This option is useful when pushing images containing nondistributable artifacts to a registry on an air-gapped network so hosts on that network can pull the images without connecting to another server.  > **Warning**: Nondistributable artifacts typically have restrictions > on how and where they can be distributed and shared. Only use this > feature to push artifacts to private registries and ensure that you > are in compliance with any terms that cover redistributing > nondistributable artifacts.  | No |
| InsecureRegistryCIDRs | [ string ] | List of IP ranges of insecure registries, using the CIDR syntax ([RFC 4632](https://tools.ietf.org/html/4632)). Insecure registries accept un-encrypted (HTTP) and/or untrusted (HTTPS with certificates from unknown CAs) communication.  By default, local registries (`127.0.0.0/8`) are configured as insecure. All other registries are secure. Communicating with an insecure registry is not possible if the daemon assumes that registry is secure.  This configuration override this behavior, insecure communication with registries whose resolved IP address is within the subnet described by the CIDR syntax.  Registries can also be marked insecure by hostname. Those registries are listed under `IndexConfigs` and have their `Secure` field set to `false`.  > **Warning**: Using this option can be useful when running a local > registry, but introduces security vulnerabilities. This option > should therefore ONLY be used for testing purposes. For increased > security, users should add their CA to their system's list of trusted > CAs instead of enabling this option.  | No |

#### ClusterVolume

Options and information specific to, and only present on, Swarm CSI
cluster volumes.


| Name | Type | Description | Required |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | -------- |
| ID | string | The Swarm ID of this volume. Because cluster volumes are Swarm objects, they have an ID, unlike non-cluster volumes. This ID can be used to refer to the Volume instead of the name.  | No |
| Version | [ObjectVersion](#ObjectVersion) |  | No |
| CreatedAt | string (dateTime) |  | No |
| UpdatedAt | string (dateTime) |  | No |
